                     <p>The Women and Men of Crypto stage the beginning of the legacy in the Metaverse-where the possibilities are endless. When one holds both the Women and Men of Crypto NFTs, something special can happen. When the  two digital avatars come together they will harmonize  their unique physical characteristics to render their own avatar. This equal blending of two distinctive embodiments is how the next Generation begins. We call this manifestation the “Baby of Crypto.”

                     <p>
                        The high quality, 3D rendered, baby avatar will preserve the same concept and style behind the female and male avatars. They will display, equally, the physical traits and characteristics of two particular avatars.

                     As an expression of our gratitude to our supporters, we will airdrop all those who are HOLDRs of Women of Crypto NFT with their very own “Men of Crypto” NFT, 6 weeks after the official launch.
                  </p>
                  <p> The high quality, 3D rendered, male avatars will preserve the same concept and style behind the female avatars.

                  <h3>CRYPTO GENERATIONS- The “Baby of Crypto”
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     The Women and Men of Crypto stage the beginning of the legacy in the Metaverse-where the possibilities are endless. When one holds both the Women and Men of Crypto NFTs, something special can happen. When the  two digital avatars come together they will harmonize  their unique physical characteristics to render their own avatar. This equal blending of two distinctive embodiments is how the next Generation begins. We call this manifestation the “Baby of Crypto.” 
                  </p>
                  <p> The high quality, 3D rendered, baby avatar will preserve the same concept and style behind the female and male avatars. They will display, equally, the physical traits and characteristics of two particular avatars.

                  <p>
                     From an early age, Amy Matsushima has displayed an innovative, entrepreneurial, and unbounded anima. You could say it all began in 3rd grade, wherein she recalls selling her own hand-crafted bracelets during recess. After two weeks, the demand rose, and she hired and trained fellow 8 year olds to optimize the production of the  bracelets, thus, optimizing revenue. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In 2019, she began investing and trading, powering her fascination with cryptocurrency and its historical significance. In that same year, she entered the car and boating rental business, and presently remains active in the venture. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     No matter the entrepreneurial stride, her gender has raised eye-brows, often finding herself to be the only woman amongst men in these enterprises. In the Marina, whether she is walking to her boat, or driving it, her conversations often start with, “Yes, it’s my boat,” or “Yes, I know how to drive it.” Daily, she is reminded of the gender gap (both financially and epistemically), not only in the realm of entrepreneurship as a whole, but now in the world of cryptocurrency. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Nonetheless, these disparities further motivate her to actively pursue and work towards educating and empowering underrepresented individuals. Ultimately, she is committed to inducing the shift necessary to ensure the equal opportunity of women in the global marketplace. With this current opportunity, she firmly believes every person has a place on the blockchain, and should feel able to partake in this technological and financial revolution at hand. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     She is a Woman of Crypto.

                  <h5><strong>ALL Holders of Women of Crypto NFTs will have access to the following:</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                     Our team has composed comprehensive, exclusive pre-filmed Courses* detailing and explaining everything from the fundamentals of NFTs, The Metaverse, to step-by-step illustrating how one can start their own NFT project. Most importantly, they will provide the blueprint for a successful and exciting project. The Courses will be made available to members via a private Discord channel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     When you are ready to kick-start your very own project, we will have 10 spots open for your ideas to manifest into reality! Through our own “incubator” process, you will have the ability to present to us your unique NFT proposition. The team and community will select 10 of the most promising and innovative and NFT projects. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Once the 10 Members chosen:

                  <ol>
                     <li>We will completely take you under our wing! We will work with you 1 on 1, and will devote ourselves to granting you the highest quality of mentorship (be it for, start to finish development, marketing, etc.) to ultimately ensure that each selected member yields a successful project. </li>
                     <li>
                        We promise to help fund the NFT projects of the 10 Selected Members. 
                     </li>
